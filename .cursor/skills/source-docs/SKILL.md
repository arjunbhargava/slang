# Docs built from source

Reference documentation is compiled from the source, the way Sphinx autodoc
does it. It is never written by hand. Docstrings and doc comments are the single
source of truth for what an API does. The build turns them into one site,
together with the hand-written explanation pages and architecture diagrams. If
the code and docs disagree, the build fails.

## Rules

1. **Never hand-write API reference.** Hand-written pages are only
   explanation, how-to, or tutorial content (see `architecture-docs`), and they
   link into the generated reference.
   They link only to other docs pages or absolute URLs, and name other repo
   files as code paths (`docs/diagrams/`), because the strict build rejects
   links it can't resolve.
2. **One command builds everything.** `docs/build.sh` runs every language's
   generator, then the hub build. Agents, CI, and humans all run the same
   command.
3. **Warnings are errors.** An undocumented public symbol, a broken
   cross-reference, or a malformed docstring fails the build.
4. **Never commit built output.** `docs/_build/` and `docs/_generated/` are
   gitignored.
5. **Every PR that changes public code or docs runs the build.** Its PR body
   lists the build under verification.
6. **The first PR that adds code to a repo also adds the docs build.** Any PR
   that adds a language adds its generator in the same PR.

## Hub and stitching

Use Sphinx as the hub, with MyST for Markdown and the Furo theme, whatever the
languages. It is the only mature hub that can read several languages natively
and also take in Markdown and HTML from other generators. Architecture
diagrams are committed D2 SVGs (see `architecture-docs`), so they appear in the
site as ordinary images. The build fails if any SVG is stale.

Bring each language in through the first option that works, in this order:

1. **Native.** A Sphinx extension reads the source, giving shared search,
   theme, and cross-references.
2. **Markdown.** The language's generator emits Markdown, which MyST renders
   inside the site theme.
3. **Embedded HTML.** The canonical generator's HTML is copied under
   `api/<lang>/` and linked from a stub page. Search and theme are separate,
   but it still lives in one site.

| Language | Integration | Generator | Coverage gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Python | Native | `sphinx-autoapi` + `napoleon` (parses source, no import) | `ruff` `D` rules, Google convention, ignore `D107`; `nitpicky = True` |
| TypeScript / JS | Markdown | TypeDoc + `typedoc-plugin-markdown`, `--outputFileStrategy modules` | `--validation.notDocumented --treatWarningsAsErrors` |
| Rust | Embedded HTML | `cargo doc --no-deps` | `#![deny(missing_docs)]`, `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings"` |
| Go | Markdown | `gomarkdoc` | `revive` with the `exported` rule |
| C / C++ | Native | Doxygen XML → Breathe | `WARN_IF_UNDOCUMENTED=YES`, `WARN_AS_ERROR=YES` |
| Other | Markdown if the generator can emit it, else embedded HTML | The language's canonical generator | The generator's warnings-as-errors mode |

The Python, TypeScript, and Rust rows, the diagram images, and every gate
in those rows were verified end to end. The Go and C/C++ rows follow each
tool's documented flags; confirm them the first time they're used.

## Setup

Copy the templates in `assets/`:

| From | To | Then |
|---|---|---|
| `conf.py` | `docs/conf.py` | Set `project`, keep only the extensions for the repo's languages, and point `autoapi_dirs` at the Python source |
| `build.sh` | `docs/build.sh` | Keep one block per language in the repo, and fix paths such as `web/` and `--manifest-path` |

Then:

- Write `docs/index.md` with two toctrees. The "Explanation" toctree lists
  `architecture` and other hand-written pages. The "API reference" toctree
  lists `api/python/<pkg>/index`, `_generated/ts/index`, and `api/rust`, for
  whichever languages the repo has.
- For each embedded-HTML language, add a stub page such as `docs/api/rust.md`
  that links to `rust/<crate>/index.html`.
- Declare the Python docs dependencies with the repo's other dev dependencies:
  `sphinx`, `sphinx-autoapi`, `myst-parser`, `furo`, and `ruff`, plus `breathe` if the repo has C or C++. Put the TypeDoc packages
  in `devDependencies`.
- Configure `ruff` in `pyproject.toml`:

  ```toml
  [tool.ruff.lint]
  extend-select = ["D"]
  ignore = ["D107"]

  [tool.ruff.lint.pydocstyle]
  convention = "google"
  ```

- Add `docs/_build/` and `docs/_generated/` to `.gitignore`.

## What a doc comment contains

Write for someone calling the code who hasn't read its body:

- **Summary line:** what it does, in the imperative mood.
- **Parameters:** meaning, units, valid range, and what happens outside it.
  Write `rate_hz: sample rate in Hz, > 0`, not `rate: the rate`.
- **Return value and errors:** what is returned, what can be raised or
  returned as an error, and when.
- **Invariants and side effects:** state it mutates, I/O, thread safety, and
  cost when it isn't obvious (for example, O(n²) in the history length).
- **Example:** a short one that runs. Python doctests run under
  `pytest --doctest-modules`, and Rust doc tests under `cargo test --doc`. In
  languages without runnable examples, keep the example minimal and cover the
  same behaviour in a test.

Don't restate the signature or the types, and don't narrate the
implementation. Private helpers need a comment only when a constraint is
non-obvious.

## Verify

1. Run `docs/build.sh`; it must exit 0.
2. Check that each gate still fires: add an undocumented public symbol in one
   language, confirm the build fails, then revert. Do this whenever the build
   script or the gates change.
3. Open `docs/_build/html/index.html`, or screenshot the pages the PR changed,
   including the architecture page in light and dark mode. Attach the
   screenshots to the PR.
