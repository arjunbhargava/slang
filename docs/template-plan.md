# Plan: a team template repository

Status: plan, not started. This document describes a starter repository for the
team's projects and the order to build it in. It is written for the people and
agents building the template. Copy it into the new repository as its first
commit.

## Goal

Every new project starts from one repository that already has:

- Instructions that Cursor agents follow (rules and skills).
- Pinned tool versions and one set of commands that people, agents, and
  continuous integration (CI) all run the same way.
- A working example and checks for each core language: Python, TypeScript,
  Rust, and C/C++.
- CI on GitHub Actions that enforces the rules, rather than relying on agents
  to remember them.
- A way for agents to launch long machine-learning or simulation jobs on
  separate compute, safely and within a budget.
- Support for several agents working at once without breaking each other's
  work.

Agents write most of the code. People design the structure and review every
change. The template is built around that split: its main job is to make each
change cheap and reliable for a person to review.

## Terms

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Rule | A short instruction file in `.cursor/rules/`. "Always applied" rules are loaded into every agent session. |
| Skill | A longer how-to file in `.cursor/skills/`, read by an agent only when its task needs it. |
| Cloud agent | A Cursor agent that runs on its own virtual machine and branch, and opens a pull request (PR). |
| Template repository | A repository new projects are copied from. |
| Copier | A tool that creates a project from a template and can later pull template updates into it. |
| Lockfile | A generated file that records the exact version of every dependency. |
| Merge queue | A GitHub feature that tests each PR combined with everything ahead of it before merging, so two PRs that pass separately can't break `main` together. |
| Mutation testing | A check on test quality: a tool makes small deliberate bugs in the code and reports which ones the tests fail to catch. |
| Hermetic test | A test that depends only on its own inputs: no shared files, ports, databases, or test order. |
| Launcher | The one tool agents use to start compute jobs on other machines. |
| Run record | A small file written by every compute job that records the exact code, image, settings, and hardware used. |
| Handoff | The PR description, which tells the reviewer what was done, how it was checked, and what was not. |

## What the evidence says

These findings shaped the plan. Most are 2026 preprints and some use small
benchmarks, so treat the numbers as direction rather than precise effects.

| # | Finding | What the plan does about it |
|---|---|---|
| F1 | Repository instruction files such as `AGENTS.md` raised cost by about 20% and did not raise success rates. Agents follow every instruction, so unnecessary ones make tasks harder. Repository overviews did not help. [1] | Keep always-applied rules few and short. Put detail in skills. Keep `AGENTS.md` to commands and unusual requirements. |
| F2 | Skills written by people raised success by about 16 points on average (about 5 for software tasks). Skills an agent wrote for itself did not help, and sometimes hurt. Short, focused skills beat long ones. [2] | People write or edit every skill. Changes to `.cursor/` need a person's review. |
| F3 | About half of agent PRs that passed the tests would not have been merged by the projects' maintainers. The main reasons were not really fixing the problem, breaking other code, and poor code quality. [3] | Passing tests is not enough. Add an independent review step, test-quality checks, and a clearer handoff. |
| F4 | Telling agents to "use test-driven development" or "use property-based testing" made little difference; agents went through the motions. Tests that state concrete expected behaviour did help. [4][5] | Don't require a process. Require one named test for each acceptance criterion, and measure test quality with mutation testing. |
| F5 | A second model reviewing finished code helped more than a model planning before the code was written. Good plans help, but a bad plan is worse than none. [6][7] | People approve plans only for larger changes. Every PR gets a review by a separate agent before a person sees it. |
| F6 | Asking agents for a structured handoff made their work easier to review, not more correct. Sections such as "known limitations" appeared only when required. [8] | The PR template requires those sections. |
| F7 | In Cursor's experiments with hundreds of agents, agents coordinating through a shared file with locks collapsed to the speed of 1–3 agents. What worked was a planner that splits the work, workers that each own one task on their own copy of the code, and a handoff back to the planner. [9] | Plans and task lists live in Linear, not in a shared file. Each task becomes one agent, one branch, and one PR. |
| F8 | Splitting closely connected code between agents created broken interfaces and rework. Isolated workspaces plus git merges and tests worked well. [10][11] | Agree the interface first and land it, then split the work. Use a merge queue. |
| F9 | At Meta, engineers accepted 73% of tests generated to catch specific deliberate bugs. [12] | Use mutation testing to measure whether agent-written tests catch real mistakes. |

## Decisions

Each decision has a recommended default. Agents proceed with the default unless
a person has recorded a different choice here.

| # | Decision | Recommended default | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | How projects are created from the template and receive later updates | Copier | A GitHub template copies files once; later changes to rules and skills never reach existing projects. Copier can pull them in later, and can include only the languages a project needs. Cost: one more tool, and some combinations of languages go untested. |
| D2 | Tool version manager and command runner | `mise` | One file (`mise.toml`) pins the versions of Python, Node, `uv`, `d2`, and so on, and defines the shared commands. Works the same locally, in agents, and in CI. |
| D3 | Python dependency manager | `uv`; switch to `pixi` for projects that need compiled scientific libraries | `uv` is fast and handles normal Python packages. `pixi` uses conda-forge, which also packages MPI, HDF5, CUDA libraries, and compilers. |
| D4 | Where compute jobs run | SkyPilot | One job description runs on the major clouds, GPU providers, Kubernetes, or a Slurm cluster. Switch to Slurm with Apptainer if the team has a university or lab cluster, since those clusters usually don't allow Docker. |
| D5 | Licence | Ask the owner | No default. |
| D6 | Merge method | Merge commits; no squash | The rules ask for commit history that reads as the review story. Squashing erases it. |
| D7 | Which changes need a person to approve a plan before coding | New module; change to a public interface or data format; new dependency; compute spend above the cost limit | Planning has a cost and only pays off for larger changes. |
| D8 | Cost limit for one agent-launched compute job before asking a person | Ask the owner | Set it before agents can launch jobs. |
| D9 | Open agent PRs allowed per reviewer | Start at 3 | People review everything, so review time, not agent count, limits throughput. Adjust from data. |
| D10 | Cursor plan | Ask the owner | Team pools of the team's own GPU machines for agents need the Enterprise plan. |

## The work

Each task below is one PR of at most 500 changed lines, following
`reviewable-prs`. Each must pass CI on its own. "Needs" lists the tasks that
must be merged first. Tasks with the same needs can run in parallel, each with
its own agent.

Some steps are settings in GitHub, Cursor, or Linear rather than files. Agents
can't change those settings, so they're marked **(person)**.

### Stage 1: start the repository

**T1. Create the repository with the agent instructions.** Needs: nothing.

- **(person)** Create the new repository. Mark it as a template in GitHub
  settings if D1 is "GitHub template".
- Copy from the `slang` repository: `.cursor/rules/`, `.cursor/skills/`, and
  `docs/template-plan.md` (this file).
- Remove everything specific to slang. The skills mention slang as an example
  in a few places; replace those with neutral examples.
- Write a short `README.md` covering what the template is, how to start a
  project from it, and links to this plan and the skills.
- Done when: no file mentions slang, and every link in the README works.

**T2. Basic repository files.** Needs: T1.

- `.editorconfig` (UTF-8, LF line endings, final newline).
- `.gitattributes`: LF line endings. Mark lockfiles and generated SVGs as
  generated, so GitHub collapses them in diffs.
- `.gitignore` for all four languages, plus `docs/_build/`,
  `docs/_generated/`, and `.env`.
- `.env.example`, listing environment variables by name with no values.
- `LICENSE` (D5) and `CODEOWNERS`. `CODEOWNERS` requires a person's review for
  `.cursor/`, `docs/architecture.md`, and public interface files.
- Done when: the files exist and CI (once T4 lands) passes on them.

**T3. Tool versions, shared commands, and agent setup.** Needs: T1.

- `mise.toml` pins tool versions and defines the commands `setup`, `fmt`,
  `lint`, `test`, `docs`, and `check`. `check` runs everything CI runs. Each
  command starts as a placeholder that each language task fills in.
- `.cursor/environment.json`: the install step runs `mise install` and
  `mise run setup`, so a cloud agent's machine matches CI.
- `AGENTS.md`: only the commands, where code lives, and requirements an agent
  wouldn't guess. Add a "Cursor Cloud specific instructions" section. No
  overview of the repository (see F1).
- Done when: a fresh cloud agent can run `mise run check` with no other setup.

**T4. CI skeleton and repository protection.** Needs: T3.

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
  - One job per language, each running only when files of that language
    change. Language tasks add their jobs; this task adds the structure.
  - A docs job that runs `docs/build.sh` once it exists.
  - Triggers on pull requests and on `merge_group`, the event the merge queue
    uses.
  - Cancels older runs of the same PR when a new commit arrives.
- A PR size check that fails above 500 changed lines, not counting lockfiles
  or generated files, unless the PR description starts with `Oversize:`.
- Security defaults:
  - Workflows get read-only permissions unless a job needs more.
  - Third-party actions are pinned to an exact commit.
  - Renovate or Dependabot opens dependency and action updates.
  - CodeQL code scanning covers all four languages.
- `.github/rulesets/main.json`: require CI to pass, require one human review,
  turn on the merge queue, and allow only merge commits (D6). Add a script or
  documented `gh api` command that applies the ruleset, because GitHub doesn't
  copy settings from templates.
- **(person)** Apply the ruleset. Turn on secret scanning with push
  protection.
- Done when: a test PR above 500 lines fails the size check, and a PR merges
  through the merge queue.

**T5. PR template.** Needs: T1. Can run alongside T2–T4.

- `.github/pull_request_template.md`, in the order from `reviewable-prs`:
  1. What changes and why, with the Linear issue ID (for example
     `Fixes ENG-123`). This links the PR to the issue.
  2. How to review: where to start, and what can be skimmed.
  3. How it was verified, including which test covers each acceptance
     criterion.
  4. What was not verified, and known limitations.
  5. Changes from the agreed plan, and problems found outside the task's
     scope. Report these as new Linear issues rather than fixing them here.
  6. Diagrams updated, or "no structural change".
  7. Risks and follow-ups.
- Update `reviewable-prs` to match.
- Done when: the template and the rule list the same sections in the same
  order.

### Stage 2: languages

Each language task adds:

- A small example module with documentation comments.
- One test.
- Formatting, lint, and type checks, with warnings treated as errors.
- Its block in `docs/build.sh`.
- Its CI job.
- A command that tests only that package.

The example exists to prove the checks work. A project deletes it when its
first real code arrives.

Every check must fail when broken. The PR shows this by breaking the check once
(for example, adding an undocumented public function), then reverting.

**T6. Python, and the documentation build.** Needs: T3, T4.

- `uv` for dependencies, Python version, and the lockfile; `ruff` for format and
  lint (including documentation-comment rules); `pyright` for types; `pytest`
  for tests, including the examples inside documentation comments.
- Tests run in parallel (`pytest -n auto`), so tests that depend on shared
  state or on order fail early.
- The documentation build from the `source-docs` skill lands here, because its
  site generator, Sphinx, is a Python tool: `docs/conf.py`, `docs/index.md`,
  and `docs/build.sh`.
- Done when: `mise run check` and `docs/build.sh` pass, and each check fails
  when broken.

**T7. TypeScript.** Needs: T6.

- `pnpm` workspace, `tsc` in strict mode, Biome for format and lint, `vitest`
  for tests, TypeDoc for documentation.

**T8. Rust.** Needs: T6.

- `rust-toolchain.toml`, a workspace with one crate, `rustfmt`,
  `clippy` with warnings as errors, `#![deny(missing_docs)]`, and `cargo-deny`
  to check dependency licences and known vulnerabilities.

**T9. C and C++.** Needs: T6.

- CMake with `CMakePresets.json`, `clang-format`, `clang-tidy`, `ctest`, and
  Doxygen with Breathe for documentation.
- One CI job builds with AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer,
  which catch memory errors and undefined behaviour at run time.
- The `source-docs` skill lists the Doxygen settings as not yet tested end to
  end; confirm them here and update the skill.
- Leave the choice of C/C++ package manager (vcpkg or CMake `FetchContent`) to
  each project.

T7, T8, and T9 can run in parallel.

### Stage 3: agent instructions

Write every new rule and skill by hand, or have an agent draft it and a person
edit it (F2). Keep each skill short and focused.

**T10. Restructure the always-applied rules.** Needs: T1.

- Today, four rules load into every session, and two of them require reading a
  skill of about 120 lines first; `clarity` does this before writing any text,
  so almost every task loads it. F1 suggests this costs more than it
  returns.
- Keep each always-applied rule to a short checklist. Load the full skill only
  when the task needs it. Don't change what the rules require.
- This changes structure only. New content goes in T11 and T12.

**T11. New rules.** Needs: T10.

- `secrets` (always applied, about 10 lines): secrets come from environment
  variables, set through the Cursor dashboard for agents. Never commit them or
  write them to logs. `.env.example` lists the names.
- `dependencies`: a new dependency needs a one-line reason in the PR, a
  committed lockfile, and a passing licence check. On a lockfile merge
  conflict, regenerate the lockfile; never edit it by hand.
- `compute-cost` (always applied): the cost limit (D8), and stop to ask a
  person above it.

**T12. New skills.** Needs: T10. Split into two PRs if over 500 lines.

- `testing`:
  - One named test per acceptance criterion.
  - Tests are hermetic and can run in parallel.
  - Every external resource a test or job creates (bucket, port, tracker run)
    has the branch name or run ID in its name.
  - Paid or live-service tests run only when asked for, never in normal CI.
  - For numerical code, the checks that catch the most errors: the error
    shrinks at the expected rate as the step size shrinks; conserved
    quantities (energy, mass, momentum) stay within a stated bound; results
    match known exact solutions; results respect the problem's symmetries.
    Compare floating-point values with stated tolerances, never exact
    equality.
- `spec`: for changes that meet the D7 threshold, write a short plan covering
  the problem, the interface, the files touched, and the acceptance criteria.
  Then stop until a person approves it.
- `decompose`: turn an approved plan into Linear sub-issues. Each sub-issue
  states the interface it builds or uses, the files it owns, acceptance
  criteria, the command that checks it, and which other sub-issues it waits
  for. Land shared interfaces first, as their own PR. Keep closely connected
  work in one task rather than splitting it (F8).
- `add-language`: the steps from Stage 2 as a checklist, so a project can add
  a language later.

### Stage 4: review and quality checks

**T13. Independent review before a person reviews.** Needs: T5. See F3 and
F5.

- `.cursor/BUGBOT.md` tells Cursor's review agent to check the diff against
  the issue's acceptance criteria and the repository rules.
- **(person)** Turn on Bugbot for the repository.
- The agent fixes what the reviewer finds before asking for a person's review.

**T14. Mutation testing.** Needs: T7, T8, T9.

- Run mutation testing on changed code in CI (F4, F9). At first it reports results
  only; it doesn't block merging. Tools: `cargo-mutants` (Rust), `mutmut`
  (Python), StrykerJS (TypeScript), Mull (C/C++; the least mature).
- Decide after a month of data whether to make it blocking.

**T15. Enforce module boundaries.** Needs: T7, T8, T9.

- People own the structure, so check it with tools instead of relying on
  instructions. Use `import-linter` for Python and `dependency-cruiser` for
  TypeScript. For Rust, crate dependencies plus `cargo-deny` bans enforce it.
  For C/C++, use CMake target visibility.
- The example modules get one boundary rule each, to prove the check works.

### Stage 5: compute jobs

**T16. Compute job support.** Needs: T6, D4, D8.

- A base container image (`Dockerfile`) with pinned CUDA versions. CI builds
  it, tags it with the commit, and pushes it to GitHub's container registry.
  Jobs use the image's digest, so the exact image is recorded.
- A run record helper. Every job writes the commit, whether there were
  uncommitted changes, the image digest, the full settings, random seeds, the
  hardware and driver, and start and end times.
- The `compute-jobs` skill covers:
  - How to launch a job, check its status, and fetch results with the
    launcher (D4).
  - Default limits: maximum run time, automatic shutdown when idle,
    interruptible machines with checkpoints, and a cap on GPU count.
  - How to report results in the PR.
- How agents learn a job finished: a GitHub Actions workflow launches the job
  and waits for it. A Cursor Automation on "workflow run completed" then
  starts a follow-up agent to read the results. Use the Cursor API or a webhook
  only if this doesn't cover a case.
- Tests that need a GPU are marked and run nightly, or on request, on a
  self-hosted GPU runner. Ordinary CI uses small CPU-sized settings.
- Large data and checkpoints go to object storage (S3 or similar), never git.
- **(person)** Create a separate cloud account or project for agent jobs, with
  provider-side budget limits and a service account. Add its credentials as
  Cursor secrets. If using an egress allowlist, add the cloud, registry,
  tracker, and storage domains.

### Stage 6: Linear

**T17. Linear setup.** Needs: T5. Mostly **(person)**.

- Connect the Cursor and Linear integrations, and the Linear GitHub
  integration.
- Create a label group named exactly `repo`, with one label per repository
  (`owner/name`), and put it on each Linear project. This tells Cursor which
  repository an issue belongs to.
- Set the default repository, model, and base branch in the Cursor dashboard.
- Create a Linear issue template:
  - Goal (1–2 sentences).
  - Acceptance criteria, written as checkable behaviour.
  - The command that verifies it.
  - Out of scope.
  - Compute budget.
  - Links to designs.
- Add an `agent-ready` label. Assign only those issues to agents.
- Use one sub-issue per PR for work split into several PRs, so merging the
  first PR doesn't close the whole issue.
- In the repository: `docs/linear.md`, listing these conventions in a few
  lines.

### Stage 7: template mechanics

**T18. Convert to Copier.** Needs: all earlier tasks, D1.

- Turn the repository into a Copier template with one yes/no question per
  language.
- CI creates a project with all languages, then one project per single
  language (five variants), and runs `mise run check` in each.
- If D1 is "GitHub template", replace this task with documented steps for
  deleting unused languages.

### Later

**T19. Measure the instructions.** After about 10 real tasks have been done in
projects that use the template.

- Rerun closed tasks with different instructions (for example, with and without
  a rule). Score each run by hidden tests and a person's "would merge"
  judgement.
- Track: PRs merged without change requests, review rounds per PR, review
  time, and reverts within 30 days.
- Repeat after each model upgrade, and remove instructions that no longer
  help.

## Order and parallel work

```text
T1 ─┬─ T2
    ├─ T3 ── T4 ── T6 ─┬─ T7 ─┐
    │                  ├─ T8 ─┼─ T14, T15
    │                  ├─ T9 ─┘
    │                  └─ T16 (also needs D4, D8)
    ├─ T5 ─┬─ T13
    │      └─ T17
    └─ T10 ─┬─ T11
            └─ T12
T18 needs everything above.
```

Right after T1, four tasks (T2, T3, T5, T10) can start at once. Keep the
number of open agent PRs within the review limit in D9 rather than starting
everything that is ready. Start a task only when everything it needs has
merged.

## How agents work on this repository

- One task, one Linear sub-issue, one agent, one branch, one PR.
- A planner (a person, or an agent using `decompose` once T12 exists) creates
  the tasks. Workers don't coordinate with each other; they report back
  through the PR description.
- Shared state lives in git and Linear only. No shared task files, no shared
  databases or fixed ports, and every external resource name includes the
  branch or run ID.
- An agent that finds a problem outside its task files a Linear issue instead
  of fixing it.
- The merge queue tests each PR combined with the ones ahead of it before
  merging.
- For a hard task, run several agents on it separately and review only the
  best result. Parallel agents should not multiply review work.

## Not in scope

- A custom system for coordinating agents. Cursor already provides subagents,
  an API, automations, and Linear routing.
- Agents talking to each other directly, or shared memory files.
- A dedicated agent for merging other agents' work. The merge queue covers it,
  and Cursor found such a role slowed things down [9].
- Release automation, deployment, and choices of C/C++ package manager or
  experiment tracker. These belong to each project.
- Go. It appears in the `source-docs` skill but isn't a team language; remove
  it in T1.
